## Aim

This project aims to conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) of crime data from the provided `crime_data_clean.csv`. The main objectives of this analysis are:

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**: Load and clean the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types where necessary.

2. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the distribution of various income sources (e.g., wages, farm/self-employment income, investment income, social security, public assistance, retirement) to identify key patterns and trends. Each visualization is accompanied by a brief commentary summarizing the observations.

3. **Statistical Analysis**: Explore the relationships between income sources and crime rates. This involves creating scatter plots and correlation matrices to examine how different income types might correlate with crime statistics across different regions.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Conduct statistical tests, specifically T-Tests, to compare the percentage of households receiving public assistance in the ten most populated communities in Florida and California. This includes a detailed explanation of the results and interpretation of p-values to understand if the differences observed are statistically significant.

The final deliverable is a Jupyter Notebook that provides both the code and a detailed discussion of the findings. The notebook is also converted into a PDF format for ease of distribution and presentation.
